# Pandas-Challenge

In this assignment Pandas DataFrames was used to manipulate and organize data effectively. I had access to detailed information about each student's math and reading scores, along with data about the schools they attend.
By aggregating this data, the objective was to identify and present clear trends in school performance that can provide valuable insights for decision-making processes. This analysis will be instrumental in understanding the overall academic landscape of the district and identifying areas for improvement and strategic allocation of resources.

In conclusion, 
The analysis of the data indicates that the pass rate for reading scores was higher than the pass rate for math scores. Additionally, charter schools outperformed district schools in terms of academic achievement. However, it was observed that the level of spending had no significant effect on the students' test scores.
